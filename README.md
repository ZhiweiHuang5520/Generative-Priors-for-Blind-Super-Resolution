## Generative-Priors-for-Blind-Super-Resolution

Prior information is very important in SR problems, and SR methods with MAP
architecture usually require kernel estimation and image priors. Many existing SR
methods are based on fixed blur kernel assumptions, such as bicubic downsampling.
However, when the actual image does not conform to this fixed assumption, or when
the kernel estimation effect is poor in the blind SR problem, the performance of the
SR results drops sharply. For the image prior, it is also beneficial to use the network
structure itself as a prior method, but it is computationally expensive and impractical
in practical applications. To deal with these issues, we propose fully generated
prior information and fuse it into the encoder-decoder structure, the Generative
Priors for Blind Super-Resolution (GPBSR). Using VAE self-supervision to learn
the bijection of the latent space and blur kernel, and the latent space obeys the
Gaussian distribution and conforms to the characteristics of the kernel itself, so
that the kernel prior information generated by sampling can be well integrated
into different SR model frameworks. Similarly, using GANs pre-trained on large
datasets can also characterize the prior distribution of the data, with rich and diverse
prior information on the input LR map output.
